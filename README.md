# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects — Python | SQL | Excel

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains hands-on **data cleaning and preprocessing projects** performed using **Python (Pandas), SQL, and Excel**.
Each project demonstrates how raw, messy datasets are transformed into **analysis-ready clean datasets** using real-world data cleaning techniques.

The focus of this repository is on:

* Identifying data quality issues
* Applying appropriate cleaning methods
* Preparing datasets for further analysis and visualization

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Projects are organized by tool:

```
📁 python/
📁 sql/
📁 excel/
README.md
```

Inside each folder, files are named in sequence to show the workflow:

```
01_<project>_raw_data
02_<project>_data_cleaning
03_<project>_cleaned_data
```

This represents:

* **01** → Original uncleaned dataset
* **02** → Cleaning process (notebook / queries / formulas)
* **03** → Final cleaned dataset ready for analysis
